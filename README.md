# IPT2018-WEEKLY-REPORT

Week one

    - introdusing of member of parrotaiIPT2018
    
    - We set goals for the week according to the schedule which involes reading several chapters from selected book
    
    - pass through notebooks about intro to python on ML, and selected online courses 
    
    - Also understanding proposed project to be done using Machine Learning.
    
    - Doing week one challenge, that we predict whether a student will drop out or no.
   
  Through the first week i was able to understanding general meaning of what is machine learning, 
  that is technique of finding solution or getting insights about complex problems and large amount of data. 
  and types of classification of machine learning that is

    Classification of machine learning based to the amount and type of supervision they get during training 
      (Supervised, Unsupervised, Semisupervised and Reinforcement Learning)

    Classification of machine learning based whether the system can learn itself from the stream of incoming data 
      (Batch learning and online Learning)

    Classification of machine learning based on how they are generalizing 
      (Instance-Based and Model-Based Learning).

 Also, i passed through  [our Supervisor notebook](https://github.com/sambaiga/PytzMLS2018/tree/master/Python%20for%20ML%20and%20DS) 1 to 7.
 and i was able to learn some linear regression with one variable from [coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/1) first week

Also, with my group we started discussing the proposed project, and we chunk the problem upto data flow of the project (Strawberry Grading and Quality Control)

Finaly, working with week one challeng that we create a model to predict whether student will continue with their study or will drop out [See more](https://gitlab.com/PERESI/parrotai-ipt2018/blob/master/week_1_challenge/data/week%20one%20challenge%20solution/student_prediction_complete.ipynb) through week challenge i also learn how  to choose important feature which will result efficient on training 

A weekly challenge,
    -  it is bit tough with alot of difficult, I'm still catching up with mode of learning but i really enjoying it because I have got alot through this. and from this busy week help me to understand concept of Machine Learning, to design simple model prediction using scikit - learn library.
